Further analysis of the cyber event has given a strong indication that a subgroup of eight individuals were behind the bug. The CGCS has received a tip that this group rarely meets in person and instead they use a special itema totemas a secret signal of their affiliation. This item is unremarkable to those who are not part of the group; it could easily be confused for a free item handed out at a conference. The CGCS gathered all records associated with the group from their offline archives including text and photos that potential group members posted on the Y*INT social media platform. Investigators at the CGCS need your help analyzing the contents of those records to look for clues to the identity of the eight individuals.",

        "Description": "This global outage event has raised awareness for the need to be able to assemble a rapid response team in the case of a future outage event. The white hat community recognizes that serious delays result when CGCS has to go through a complex process to respond to a future event. The white hat community decides to provide CGCS with much more information about their individual expertise, contact information, available tools, and any other information they think could be useful. They want CGCS to be able to search this network and quickly assemble a set of superstars with complementary skills who can be part of an emergency response team. CGCSs current visual analytics environment supports basic situation awareness and provides a set of simple tools to help them see patterns in individual data sets. However, the existing system will not support the new data that the white hat community is providing. CGCS recognizes that they need a new visual analytics environment, and they would like you to design it. CGCS wants this environment to support two tasks: * High level situation awareness of issues with the global internet, including reports of the emergence of new network attacks, reports of significant network failures, and activities of the white hat community. * Ability to assemble a team from across the white hat community to respond to new events. The CGCS wants to be able to identify one or more experts experienced in a particular issue using all of the data available to them, including resumes, news article mentions, publications, and self-reported expertise. If no experts are found, CGCS may need to infer which of their experts they should ask for ideas about who to contact. In some cases, a full team may have to be assembled, bringing together multiple people with complementary skills who will be able to work well together. CGCS wants to incorporate as much machine learning into the system as possible, but they want to have insight into not only what the machine learning is doing, but what uncertainties exist in both the data and the algorithms. However, CGCS personnel are not experts in machine learning, so they want to have explanations that make sense to them. Your objective is to design for the new CGCS situation awareness and team development environment, illustrating how visual analytics can support CGCS tasks.",

Fuse the data in the mini challenges to give officials a fuller situational awareness than is possible with any individual data sources. Officials are especially interested in understanding how the uncertainty in
      each source interacts with the others. Can sources reinforce or refute findings in other sources? Does combining sources bring the situation into clearer view or just increase confusion? The citizens of St. Himark are trying to assist their government by providing more information than official channels would be able to on their own, but you must help fuse those sources into a form that allows officials to do their job as efficiently and with the greatest impact possible.",

They quickly receive seismic readings and use those for an initial deployment but realize they need more information to make sure they have a realistic understanding of the true conditions throughout the city.
      In a prescient move of community engagement, the city had released a new damage reporting mobile application shortly before the earthquake. This app allows citizens to provide more timely information to the city to help them understand damage and prioritize their response. In this mini-challenge, use app responses in conjunction with shake maps of the earthquake strength to identify areas of concern and advise emergency planners. Note: the shake maps are from April 6 and April 8 respectively.With emergency services stretched thin, officials are relying on citizens to provide them with much needed information about the effects of the quake to help focus recovery efforts.
      By combining seismic readings of the quake, responses from the app, and background knowledge of the city, help the city triage their efforts for rescue and recovery.",

      "Description": "One of St. Himark's largest employers is the Always Safe nuclear power plant. The pride of the city, it produces power for St. Himark's needs and exports the excess to the mainland providing a steady revenue stream. However, the plant was not compliant with international standards when it was constructed and is now aging. As part of its outreach to the broader community, Always Safe agreed to provide funding for a set of carefully calibrated professional radiation monitors at fixed locations throughout the city. Additionally, a group of citizen scientists led by the members of the Himark Science Society started an education initiative to build and deploy lower cost homemade sensors, which people can attach to their cars. The sensors upload data to the web by connecting through the user's cell phone. The goal of the project was to engage the community and demonstrate that the nuclear plant's operations were not significantly changing the region's natural background levels of radiation.When an earthquake strikes St. Himark, the nuclear power plant suffers damage resulting in a leak of radioactive contamination. Further, a coolant leak sprayed employees' cars and contaminated them at varying levels. Now, the city's government and emergency management officials are trying to understand if there is a risk to the public while also responding to other emerging crises related to the earthquake as well as satisfying the public's concern over radiation.",

      "Description": "Seismic and survey data are useful for capturing the objective damage that the earthquake has caused St. Himark. However, this data has limitations. First, official surveys are time consuming and do not stay current in a rapidly changing situation. Second, they don't establish how citizens are reacting to the current crisis. Third, they are often insufficiently granular, providing little insight into differences between neighborhoods. In other words, the seismic and survey data do not provide an up-to-date view of the structural and humanitarian impact caused by the earthquake on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. The City has concluded that this knowledge is necessary to determine where to allocate emergency resources.
      City Officials have identified a subset of Y*INT, a community-based social media platform, as a potential source for revealing the current state of St. Himark's neighborhoods and people. Knowing that you are skilled in visual analytics, the City has asked you to analyze Y*INT messages in order to determine the appropriate actions it must take in order to assist the community in this disaster.",

      The Boonsong Lekagul Nature Preserve is used by local residents and tourists for day-trips, overnight camping or sometimes just passing through to access main thoroughfares on the opposite sides of the preserve. The entrance booths of the preserve are monitored in order to generate revenue as well as monitor usage. Vehicles entering and exiting the preserve must pay a fee based on their number of axles (personal auto, recreational trailer, semi-trailer, etc.). This generates a data stream with entry/exit timestamps and vehicle type. There are also other locations in the part that register traffic passing through. While hiking through the various parts of the preserve, Mitch has noticed some odd behaviors of vehicles that he doesn't think are consistent with the kinds of park visitors he would expect.

      Note: This scenario and all the people, places, groups, technologies, contained therein are fictitious. Any resemblance to real people, places, groups, or technologies is purely coincidental.
      In the roughly twenty years that Tethys-based GAStech has been operating a natural gas production site in the island country of Kronos, it has produced remarkable profits and developed strong relationships with the government of Kronos. However, GAStech has not been as successful in demonstrating environmental stewardship.
      In January, 2014, the leaders of GAStech are celebrating their new-found fortune as a result of the initial public offering of their very successful company. In the midst of this celebration, several employees of GAStech go missing. An organization known as the Protectors of Kronos (POK) is suspected in the disappearance, but things may not be what they seem.
      As an expert in visual analytics, you are called in to help law enforcement from Kronos and Tethys assess the situation and figure out where the missing employees are and how to get them home again. Time is of the essence.
      In the Grand Challenge, you are asked to put all the pieces together. Who disappeared? Who was responsible for the disappearance? And what were the underlying motivations for the disappearance?",

It is decidedly different from previous VAST challenges - it will be continuous and iterative, it will have reviewing and recognition presented from now until the final judging session, contestants will be required to register to participate and login to this site to get data and make submissions. Results will be posted on this website as we go. Contestants can join at any time - there will be awards for long term successes at predictions, but there will also be plenty of interim recognition.

        The theme is movie success at the box office and in viewer ratings. Participants will be asked to predict how well a set of movies will do at the box office in terms of box office take (ticket sales) and how well they will do in the eyes of the viewers (the movies' viewer ratings) for their opening weekend in the U.S. A key feature of the challenge, though, is that contestants will use visual analytics to support their movie analysis and show us how it was used in their analytic processes. So, while the two numeric predictions would be possible to provide by plugging lots of data into a model, we will ask some additional questions to go along with the predictions that will require a human-in-the-loop and hopefully some outstanding visualizations.",

Our system synthesizes the daily, weekly and seasonal syndromic trends seen in Indiana Emergency Departments and allows users to inject outbreaks into the data, thereby creating a dataset in which analysts can be asked to solve a problem with a known solution, allowing for standard evaluations amongst various techniques. Data generated includes synthetic patient location and demographic information (age and gender) along with the Emergency Department chief complaint and chief complaint classification. Sample data sets are available for download.",
