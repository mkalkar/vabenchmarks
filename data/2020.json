You have been asked to examine CGCS records and identify those groups who most closely resemble the identified profile.",

    "Description":"Overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster, city of Himark officials are looking for help to build a more complete understanding of the situation on the ground. They have access to multiple data sources, but each on its own is an incomplete view into the situation. Fuse the data in the mini challenges to give officials a fuller situational awareness than is possible with any individual data sources. Officials are especially interested in understanding how the uncertainty in each source interacts with the others. Can sources reinforce or refute findings in other sources? Does combining sources bring the situation into clearer view or just increase confusion? The citizens of St. Himark are trying to assist their government by providing more information than official channels would be able to on their own, but you must help fuse those sources into a form that allows officials to do their job as efficiently and with the greatest impact possible.",

    "Description": "St. Himark has been hit by an earthquake, leaving officials scrambling to determine the extent of the damage and dispatch limited resources to the areas in most need. They quickly receive seismic readings and use those for an initial deployment but realize they need more information to make sure they have a realistic understanding of the true conditions throughout the city.
    In a prescient move of community engagement, the city had released a new damage reporting mobile application shortly before the earthquake. This app allows citizens to provide more timely information to the city to help them understand damage and prioritize their response. In this mini-challenge, use app responses in conjunction with shake maps of the earthquake strength to identify areas of concern and advise emergency planners. Note: the shake maps are from April 6 and April 8 respectively.With emergency services stretched thin, officials are relying on citizens to provide them with much needed information about the effects of the quake to help focus recovery efforts.
    By combining seismic readings of the quake, responses from the app, and background knowledge of the city, help the city triage their efforts for rescue and recovery.",

    "Description": "One of St. Himark's largest employers is the Always Safe nuclear power plant. The pride of the city, it produces power for St. Himark's needs and exports the excess to the mainland providing a steady revenue stream. However, the plant was not compliant with international standards when it was constructed and is now aging. As part of its outreach to the broader community, Always Safe agreed to provide funding for a set of carefully calibrated professional radiation monitors at fixed locations throughout the city. Additionally, a group of citizen scientists led by the members of the Himark Science Society started an education initiative to build and deploy lower cost homemade sensors, which people can attach to their cars. The sensors upload data to the web by connecting through the user's cell phone. The goal of the project was to engage the community and demonstrate that the nuclear plant's operations were not significantly changing the region's natural background levels of radiation.When an earthquake strikes St. Himark, the nuclear power plant suffers damage resulting in a leak of radioactive contamination. Further, a coolant leak sprayed employees' cars and contaminated them at varying levels. Now, the city's government and emergency management officials are trying to understand if there is a risk to the public while also responding to other emerging crises related to the earthquake as well as satisfying the public's concern over radiation.",

    "Description": "Seismic and survey data are useful for capturing the objective damage that the earthquake has caused St. Himark. However, this data has limitations. First, official surveys are time consuming and do not stay current in a rapidly changing situation. Second, they don't establish how citizens are reacting to the current crisis. Third, they are often insufficiently granular, providing little insight into differences between neighborhoods. In other words, the seismic and survey data do not provide an up-to-date view of the structural and humanitarian impact caused by the earthquake on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. The City has concluded that this knowledge is necessary to determine where to allocate emergency resources.
    City Officials have identified a subset of Y*INT, a community-based social media platform, as a potential source for revealing the current state of St. Himark's neighborhoods and people. Knowing that you are skilled in visual analytics, the City has asked you to analyze Y*INT messages in order to determine the appropriate actions it must take in order to assist the community in this disaster.",
